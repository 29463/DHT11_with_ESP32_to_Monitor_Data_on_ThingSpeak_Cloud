o	Sign up on the ThingSpeak website.
2.	Create a New Channel:
o	Add fields for temperature and humidity.
3.	Note the API Key:
o	Copy the Write API Key for the channel.
How the Code Works
1.	Wi-Fi Initialization:
o	The ESP32 connects to the specified Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID and password.
2.	DHT11 Readings:
o	Temperature and humidity readings are acquired using the dht.readTemperature() and dht.readHumidity() functions.
3.	ThingSpeak Communication:
o	The ESP32 sends the readings to ThingSpeak using an HTTP GET request with the API key and field values.
4.	Data Visualization:
o	The data is displayed in real-time on ThingSpeak.
